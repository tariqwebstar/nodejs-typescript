# Creating a Node.js Server in TypeScript: A Step-by-Step Guide with Automatic Compilation

## Introduction

Node.js has become the go-to platform for building scalable and high-performance server-side applications, and TypeScript, with its strong typing and modern features, is an excellent choice for writing clean and maintainable code. In this guide, we will walk you through the process of creating a Node.js server in TypeScript, covering everything from setting up your development environment to handling HTTP requests, with automatic compilation using a package.json script.

## Prerequisites

Before we dive into creating our Node.js server in TypeScript, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

- **Node.js**: You'll need Node.js to run JavaScript on the server. You can download it from the official website [here](https://nodejs.org/) and install it.

- **npm**: npm (Node Package Manager) comes bundled with Node.js and is used to manage packages and dependencies.

- **TypeScript**: Install TypeScript globally using npm with the following command:

  ```bash
  npm install -g typescript
  ```
